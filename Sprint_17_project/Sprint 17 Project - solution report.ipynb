So I had to input a solution to make it so i can run the models with no issues. Otherwise, I didn't run into many issues that couldn't be quickly solved or solved with a little bit of patience."

Also creating a good reviewing system to check if the model is a good quality model or not. Not including such metrics and making it easy to understand would have created more challenges for the project."
